# Next.js Intermittent Data Fetching Error

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Next.js applications: intermittent errors during data fetching within `getStaticProps`.  The `about` page attempts to fetch data from an external API.  If the API request fails, the page may render unexpectedly, or throw an unhandled error.

## Problem

The `getStaticProps` function in `pages/about.js` makes an API call.  This API call is simulated;  in reality, this could be an external service that is sometimes unreliable or slow.  If the API request fails (simulated with a non-200 response status), the error handling isn't completely robust.  This can lead to an unhandled error and prevent the page from rendering correctly. The error doesn't always appear which makes it harder to debug.

## Solution

The solution improves the error handling in `getStaticProps`.  It checks for various error conditions, uses a default fallback, and logs detailed error messages to the console for better debugging.
